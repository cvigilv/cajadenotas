# Filter Git repo for specific files or directories

First, identify the problematic file or directory. One way is to use
the git log:

~~~
git log --all --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --name-status
~~~

From here, we filter the file or directory with:

~~~
git filter-repo --path <FILE_OR_PATH> --invert-paths
~~~

Now, check if git log shows files you wanted to filter! Troubleshoot if necessary.

After this, we SHOULD create a new repo and push the history of the current filtered repo
(recommended by the authors of git-filter-repo). Here we can change the name of the current
filtered repo to "<repo_name>-old"  and create an empty repo called "<repo_name>", then push
the filtered repo using:

~~~
git remote add origin <url_to_repo>
git push -u origin main
~~~
